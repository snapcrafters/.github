## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

We are a group of volunteers who maintain snap packages for third-party software. We publish more than [70 snaps](https://snapcraft.io/publisher/snapcrafters) used by 1.5 million weekly active devices across 50+ distributions. Our goal is to be a trusted and reliable source for high-quality snaps.

We're passionate about making the Linux desktop app ecosystem easier, more robust and more secure.

## Snapcrafters strives for quality

- We use [formal processes](https://github.com/snapcrafters/.github/blob/main/docs/PROCESSES.md) to maintain snaps so that updates are tested and high-quality before they reach users.
- We share maintenance workload over multiple people so there isn't a single point of failure.
- We write documentation and build tools to improve the quality of the whole Snap ecosystem.
- We work with interested upstream developers to transfer snap ownership to them.

Having the upstream application developer maintain and publish a snap for their application is preferred but not always possible. If the developers are not yet interested in maintaining the snap, we fill the gap.

## How to contribute

Are you interested in helping out? Would you like to improve software used by millions of people? Do you want to make the Linux app ecosystem more secure? Do you want to make it easier for users to install popular software?

There are a lot of things you can help us with.

- Let us know when a snap is outdated
- Update metadata of a snap
- Update the snap itself

The process for contributing is straightforward:

1. fork one of our repositories,
1. make a change, and
1. create a pull request.

The README of each repository might give you more information on how to get started. For more information, take a look at our [contributors guide](https://github.com/snapcrafters/.github/wiki/Contributing).

## How to take over your snap

Are you the developer of the software in one of our snaps? We would love to hand it over to you, if you're interested! Please create an issue in the repository of that snap so we can transfer it to you and help you get started with the Snap Store!

Taking control of your snap has many advantages:

- You can push new updates directly to users.
- You can view metrics of how many users you have, across which distributions, app versions and architectures.
- You can integrate snap publishing in your regular CI/CD pipeline.
